# Notes for Translation #

## Create a new translation ##

For every translation of a new language, translator need to create a new directory named in language code, e.g., "en-US". Language code should follow ISO 639 and ISO 3166 standard, for languages that is not in standard, name the directory with "no-std-LANG" where "LANG" is the full name of the language.

## Version Notation ##

The version is seperated in 3 parts: rule, score and payment. Translated edition should mark the version in each file as the same form of the original edition.
